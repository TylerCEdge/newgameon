*** ATTENTION TO ANY DEV THAT ASSISTS ME.  i HAVE VETTED THAT THE CURRENT FILE STRUCTURE IS DEPLOYABLE.  PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES WITHOUT CONSULTING WITH ME TO THE MASTER BRANCH!!!***


1.  Login currently supports the navbar login options.  I want to redo those with the card I made.



2.  Navbar needs a purpose beyond a brand.  Potentially an option to view a saved list eventually.  Once basic functionality is achieved.



3.  MongoDB is wired and functional however after making changes to the model it obviously no longer works.  Need mapping for IGDB calls.

This has what I see as a very relevant api call at the bottom labeled as a Multi-Query.

4.  Functionality for rendering the games needs to be built out still.  I like the idea of a netflixish look with a stretch goal of multiple carousels.



5.  With the other three being more important minus the stretch goals the user authentication needs to be wired to serve a purpose other than just logging in eventually.  Horse before the cart.



6.  I have an Auth0 method from the previous attempt at this project.  This should only be attempted once all other conditions have been met.
